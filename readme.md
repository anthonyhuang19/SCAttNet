Sample inference code to upscale your own images:

```bash
import torch
import cv2
from model import SuperResolutionNet

model = SuperResolutionNet()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model/model.pth")['generator_state_dict'])
model.eval()

lr_image = cv2.imread("low_res.jpg")
lr_tensor = torch.tensor(lr_image).float().div(255).unsqueeze(0).permute(0, 3, 1, 2)

with torch.no_grad():
    sr_image = model(lr_tensor).squeeze().permute(1, 2, 0).cpu().numpy()

cv2.imwrite("high_res.jpg", cv2.cvtColor((sr_image * 255).astype("uint8"), cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))
print("Generated high-res image saved as 'high_res.jpg'")
